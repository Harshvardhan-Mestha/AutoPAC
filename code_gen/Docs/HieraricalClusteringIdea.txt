In our approach to analyzing the Numerai dataset, we commence with thorough data preprocessing steps, a
cknowledging the dataset's unique structure characterized by eras denoting distinct periods.
During preprocessing, we meticulously handle missing or categorical values, prioritizing the model's inclination towards numerical data for optimal performance.

Subsequently, we employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to generate embeddings tailored to each era.
By leveraging UMAP, we condense the multidimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, effectively capturing the essence of each era while preserving critical characteristics essential for subsequent analysis.

To discern the underlying similarities between different eras, we compute the cosine similarity matrix based on the embeddings obtained from UMAP.
This matrix serves as a pivotal tool in identifying eras with similar feature distributions, paving the way for more focused analysis.

Using hierarchical clustering techniques, we group eras together based on their cosine similarity scores.
This hierarchical approach facilitates the creation of clusters comprising similar eras, enabling deeper insights into the dataset's inherent structure and dynamics.

Moving forward, we delve into TABPFN model training and evaluation, initializing placeholders for final results and models.
Within each cluster, we employ dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to condense features to fit within the TABPFN constraints.
Each cluster is trained using the TABPFN model.

Finally, we evaluate the ensemble TABPFN models, calculating the average accuracy as a metric of their effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns within the Numerai dataset.
Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to extract valuable insights and optimize predictive performance while navigating the complexities of the dataset's temporal nature and intricate feature relationships.
