you are a researcher and you are doing your literature review, you have have been provided with a systematic approach on how to read a paper, use chain of thought approach to answer and note down your finding from the paper and document it. your focus should be more on the methodology

**Here are initial guidelines for how to read a paper**  
1. **Read critically**: 
Reading a research paper must be a critical process. You should not assume that the authors are always correct. Instead, be suspicious.

Critical reading involves asking appropriate questions. 
1. If the authors attempt to solve a problem, are they solving the right problem? 
2. Are there simple solutions the authors do not seem to have considered? 
3. What are the limitations of the solution (including limitations the authors might not have noticed or clearly admitted)?
4. Are the assumptions the authors make reasonable? 
5. Is the logic of the paper clear and justifiable, given the assumptions, or is there a flaw in the reasoning?
6. If the authors present data, did they gather the right data to substantiate their argument, and did they appear to gather it in the correct manner? 
7. Did they interpret the data in a reasonable manner? 
8. Would other data be more compelling?
  
2. **Read creatively**: 
Reading a paper critically is easy, in that it is always easier to tear something down than to build it up. Reading creatively involves harder, more positive thinking.

1. What are the good ideas in this paper? 
2. Do these ideas have other applications or extensions that the authors might not have thought of? 
3. Can they be generalized further? 
4. Are there possible improvements that might make important practical differences? 
5. If you were going to start doing research from this paper, what would be the next thing you would do?  

3. **Make notes as you read the paper**:
Many people cover the margins of their copies of papers with notes. Use whatever style you prefer. If you have questions or criticisms, write them down so you do not forget them. Underline key points the authors make. Mark the data that is most important or that appears questionable. Such efforts help the first time you read a paper and pay big dividends when you have to re-read a paper after several months.

4. **After the first read-through, try to get a detailed summary the paper **.
Almost all good research papers try to provide an answer a specific question. (Sometimes the question is a natural one that people specifically set out to answer, sometimes a good idea just ends up answering a worthwhile question.) If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have probably recognized the question the authors started with with and the answer they provide. Once you have focused on the main idea, you can go back and try to outline the paper to gain insight into more specific details. Indeed, if summarizing the paper in one or two sentences is easy, go back and try to deepen your outline by summarizing the three or four most important subpoints of the main idea.

5. **Write down the detailed methodology of the paper**:
Critically analyze the methodology and if any algorithm exist understand and note that down.
