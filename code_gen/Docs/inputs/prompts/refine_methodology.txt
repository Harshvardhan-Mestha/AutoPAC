**Refining the methodology by answering these questions**
1. **Explanation**: 
    Assess whether the proposed methodology was sufficiently explained. Consider if there are any areas that need further clarification or detail.
2. **Standard vs. Modified Methods**: 
    Determine if standard methods were used or if modifications were made. If modifications were made, evaluate how effectively these changes were explained and justified.
3. **Limitations and Problems**: 
    Evaluate whether the author indicated the limitations and problems that arose while using the chosen methods. Consider if there are additional limitations or problems that need to be addressed.
4. **Appropriateness**: 
    Assess if the proposed methods are appropriate for the given idea. Consider if there are alternative methods that could be more suitable.
5. **Adaptation from Literature Review**: 
    Determine if the methodology from the literature review was effectively adapted to the high-level idea. If not, propose adaptations to integrate the findings from the literature review into your refined methodology.
