## Methodology for Numerai Prediction using Deep Incremental Learning with XGBoost

Based on the literature review and the characteristics of the Numerai dataset, we propose the following methodology using XGBoost within a Deep Incremental Learning (DIL) framework:

**1. Model Selection:**

* **XGBoost** is chosen as the primary model due to its demonstrated effectiveness for large tabular datasets with skewed distributions, as highlighted in the literature and confirmed by the Numerai feature set. 
* We acknowledge XGBoost's limitations regarding concept drift and address this by incorporating incremental retraining and ensembling strategies.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

* **Missing values:** We will handle missing values using the default XGBoost behavior, allowing the algorithm to learn the best way to impute missing data based on the training data.
* **Target selection:** We will utilize the main "target_cyrus_v4_20" for model training and evaluation, as it aligns with the Numerai hedge fund's strategy.

**3. Deep Incremental Learning Architecture:**

* We will implement a **two-layer DIL architecture**.
* **Layer 1:**
    * **Ensemble strategy:** We will employ **Jackknife feature set sampling** to create 10 diverse XGBoost models, each trained on a subset of features based on the defined feature groups. This approach leverages domain knowledge and has shown superior performance compared to random sampling.
    * **Training size:**  Each model in Layer 1 will be trained on a **rolling window of 600 eras**, balancing the need for historical context and adaptability to recent trends. 
    * **Retraining period:** Models will be retrained **every 50 eras** (approximately annually) to account for potential concept drift.
    * **Hyperparameters:** We will use the **Ansatz hyperparameter set** (max depth: 4, data/feature sampling per tree: 0.75) and the **Ansatz learning rate formula** (learning rate = 50 / boosting rounds) for efficient and stable training.
* **Layer 2:**
    * We will use **Elastic Net regression** with non-negative parameter constraints to combine the predictions from Layer 1 models at the individual stock level. This approach offers flexibility and allows for dynamic weighting of models based on their performance.

**4. Dynamic Hedging:**

* We will implement the **Tail Risk strategy** by calculating the standard deviation of predictions from Layer 1 models as a measure of investor disagreement.
* We will combine the Tail Risk strategy with the Baseline strategy (simple average of Layer 1 predictions) using **dynamic hedging**. The hedging ratio will adjust based on the recent performance of the Tail Risk strategy, providing downside protection during bear markets.

**5. Computational Considerations:**

* To handle the large Numerai dataset, we will implement the following techniques:
    * **Regular era sampling:** We will sample 25% of the data eras for training each model in Layer 1, ensuring coverage of the entire dataset while managing computational resources.
    * **Parallel training:** We will leverage the ability to train XGBoost models independently and in parallel to expedite the training process.

**6. Evaluation:**

* We will evaluate the performance of the DIL model using the Numerai portfolio metrics: Mean Correlation, Sharpe Ratio, and Calmar Ratio.
* We will compare the performance of the DIL model against the Numerai benchmark models and the example model provided by Numerai.

# Dynamic Hedging
baseline_predictions = np.mean(layer_1_predictions, axis=0)
tail_risk_predictions = np.std(layer_1_predictions, axis=0)

**Note:** This pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the methodology. The actual implementation will require further details and adjustments depending on the specific libraries and computational resources used.
