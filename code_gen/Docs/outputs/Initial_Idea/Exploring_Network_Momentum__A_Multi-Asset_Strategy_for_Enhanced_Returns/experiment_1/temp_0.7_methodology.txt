## Methodology for Numerai Prediction with Network-Inspired Techniques

While the "Network Momentum across Asset Classes" paper offers valuable insights into leveraging network effects for predicting asset returns, its direct applicability to the Numerai dataset has limitations. The key differences lie in the data structure (time series vs. tabular) and the availability of explicit economic/fundamental connections between assets. However, we can adapt the core principles of network momentum and combine them with suitable machine learning models to tackle the Numerai challenge.

**Proposed Methodology:**

1. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:**
    * **Handling Missing Values:** Address missing feature values (NaNs) using techniques like imputation (e.g., mean/median filling, KNN imputation) or by creating additional features indicating missingness.
    * **Feature Scaling:** Apply feature scaling (e.g., standardization, normalization) to ensure features have similar ranges, improving model convergence and performance.
    * **Feature Interactions:** Explore creating interaction features by multiplying or combining existing features, potentially capturing non-linear relationships.

2. **Network Construction (Optional):**
    * **Similarity-Based Networks:** Construct a network where nodes represent stocks and edges represent similarity between stocks based on features. Similarity measures like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or correlation can be used.
    * **Clustering-Based Networks:** Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group stocks with similar features into clusters. Then, construct a network where nodes represent clusters and edges represent inter-cluster relationships.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
    * **Ensemble Methods:** Consider ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines, known for their ability to handle tabular data with mixed feature types and capture non-linear relationships.
    * **Neural Networks:** Explore deep learning models like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies within eras and across features.

4. **Incorporating Network Information (if applicable):**
    * **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** If a network is constructed, utilize GNNs to incorporate network structure and node features into the prediction process. GNNs can learn representations of nodes based on their connections and features, potentially improving prediction accuracy.
    * **Network-Based Features:** Extract features from the network, such as node degree, centrality measures, or community affiliations, and include them as additional inputs to the chosen model.

5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
    * **Cross-Validation:** Use time-series cross-validation techniques to account for the overlapping nature of targets and avoid data leakage.
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model hyperparameters using grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best configuration.
    * **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using metrics aligned with Numerai's evaluation criteria, such as correlation, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.

6. **Training on the Entire Dataset:**
    * **Incremental Learning:** Implement incremental learning techniques to train the model on the entire dataset in batches or epochs. This allows for handling large datasets that might not fit into memory at once.
    * **Online Learning:** Consider online learning algorithms that update the model as new data becomes available, enabling continuous adaptation to market changes.

**Pseudocode:**

model = train_model(model, data, network)  # Include network if applicable

# 4. Model Evaluation and Optimization

model = optimize_hyperparameters(model, data, network)

# 5. Training on the Entire Dataset

**This methodology combines the network-inspired concepts from the research paper with appropriate machine learning techniques for tabular data and addresses the unique challenges of the Numerai dataset. The optional network construction step allows for exploring the potential benefits of network information, while the focus on ensemble methods and neural networks ensures the ability to capture complex relationships within the data. By carefully addressing preprocessing, model selection, and training procedures, this approach aims to achieve competitive performance on the Numerai platform.**
