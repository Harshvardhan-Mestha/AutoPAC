**Paper:** Path Shadowing Monte-Carlo by Rudy Morel, St√©phane Mallat & Jean-Philippe Bouchaud

**Focus:** Methodology 

###  **Summary**

This paper introduces Path Shadowing Monte-Carlo (PS-MC), a method for predicting future price paths and options prices using generative models. It addresses the challenge of conditioning generative models on past price history by searching for similar paths in a large generated dataset. The paper utilizes a maximum entropy model based on Scattering Spectra (SS) to generate paths that capture key statistical properties of financial prices.

### **Methodology**

1. **Scattering Spectra (SS) Model:**
    * **Motivation:** Traditional low-parameter generative models often fail to capture the complex statistical properties of financial prices. SS provides a richer set of statistics based on multi-scale analysis using wavelet transforms.
    * **Construction:**
        * **Wavelet Increments:** Decompose price variations into different scales using wavelet filters.
        * **Time-Scale Dependencies:** Capture dependencies across time and scales using low-order moments of wavelet increments.
        * **Multi-scale Skewness and Kurtosis:** Normalize moments to obtain multi-scale analogues of skewness and kurtosis, capturing non-Gaussian features like fat tails and volatility clustering.
    * **Model Generation:** A maximum entropy model is constructed based on the SS statistics, promoting diversity while maintaining fidelity to observed data.

2. **Path Shadowing Monte-Carlo (PS-MC):**
    * **Objective:** Estimate the conditional expectation of a future quantity given past price history.
    * **Challenge:** Finding paths with exact past history is improbable.
    * **Solution:** Relax strict conditioning by searching for "shadowing paths" whose past history is close to the observed history in a lower-dimensional embedding space.
    * **Path Embedding:** Utilize a multi-scale embedding that incorporates the influence of distant past with decaying weights.
    * **Algorithm:**
        1. Generate a large dataset of paths using the SS model.
        2. For a given past history, identify the closest shadowing paths in the generated dataset based on the embedding distance.
        3. Estimate the expected future quantity by averaging over the future of the shadowing paths with weights based on their distance to the observed history.

3. **Applications:**
    * **Volatility Prediction:** PS-MC effectively predicts future realized volatility at various time scales, outperforming benchmark methods and the Path-Dependent Volatility (PDV) model for longer time horizons.
    * **Option Pricing:** PS-MC is combined with Hedged Monte-Carlo to obtain conditional option smiles. A trading game demonstrates that the SS model with PS-MC generates smiles that outperform the PDV model and the market itself, leading to profitable trading strategies.

### **Strengths and Weaknesses**

* **Strengths:**
    * The SS model captures a wider range of statistical properties compared to traditional models, leading to more realistic and diverse generated paths.
    * PS-MC offers a flexible framework for conditioning on past history and can be applied to various generative models and prediction tasks.
    * The method demonstrates strong empirical performance in volatility prediction and option pricing.

* **Weaknesses:**
    * The scanning of a large generated dataset for shadowing paths can be computationally expensive. 
    * The method assumes stationarity of the underlying process, which may not always hold in real-world financial markets.
    * The choice of path embedding and distance metric can influence the results and requires careful consideration. 

### **Future Research Directions**

* Explore more efficient methods for identifying shadowing paths, potentially using techniques like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
* Investigate extensions to multivariate time series for capturing the interdependence of different asset prices.
* Relax the stationarity assumption and explore ways to incorporate non-stationary features into the model.
