**Methodology for Time Series Forecasting on NumerAI Dataset Using TSMixer**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling NaN Values**: Impute missing values in features and auxiliary targets using appropriate methods such as mean imputation or regression imputation based on other feature values.
   - **Feature Normalization**: Normalize the features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This aids in the efficient training of neural networks.
   - **Era-Based Segmentation**: Treat each era as a separate data point to respect the time-series nature of the data and prevent leakage.

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - **Choice of Model**: Use the TSMixer model, originally designed for multivariate time series forecasting. This choice is due to its ability to handle temporal and cross-variate information efficiently.
   - **Architecture Setup**: Configure the TSMixer with appropriate dimensions based on the dataset. This includes setting the number of features, the depth of MLP layers, and the number of mixing operations.

3. **Training Process**:
   - **Batch Preparation**: Prepare batches of data such that each batch contains complete eras. This ensures that the temporal integrity of the data is maintained.
   - **Loss Function**: Use a suitable loss function that can handle the multi-class nature of the target variable. Cross-entropy loss is a typical choice for classification tasks.
   - **Optimizer and Learning Rate**: Utilize an Adam optimizer with a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate based on validation loss performance to avoid overfitting.

4. **Validation Strategy**:
   - **Time-Based Validation**: Use a time-based cross-validation method to evaluate the model. This could involve using earlier eras for training and later eras for validation.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Measure the model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) for classification tasks.

5. **Incorporation of Auxiliary Targets**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Use auxiliary targets as additional features or for constructing enriched meta-features, potentially boosting the model's ability to predict the main target.
   - **Model Extension**: Extend the TSMixer model to handle auxiliary information by integrating these targets into the feature-mixing layers.

6. **Handling Overfitting**:
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Implement dropout in the mixing layers of TSMixer to prevent overfitting.
   - **Early Stopping**: Monitor the validation loss and stop training if the loss does not improve for a predefined number of epochs.

7. **Model Evaluation and Iteration**:
   - **Evaluation on Test Set**: After the model has been trained and validated, evaluate its performance on the unseen test set to estimate its real-world applicability.
   - **Iterative Improvement**: Based on the test results, iterate on the model architecture or training process to further enhance performance.
