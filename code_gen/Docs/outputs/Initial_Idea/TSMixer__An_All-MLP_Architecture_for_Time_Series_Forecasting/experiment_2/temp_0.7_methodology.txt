## Methodology for NumerAI Prediction using TSMixer Insights

While TSMixer demonstrates impressive performance on multivariate time series forecasting tasks, its direct application to the NumerAI dataset requires careful consideration due to several key differences:

* **Target Nature:** NumerAI focuses on predicting stock-specific returns ("alpha"), essentially a classification problem with 5 classes (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00), whereas TSMixer is designed for continuous value prediction.
* **Data Structure:** NumerAI data is tabular, with each row representing a stock at a specific time, while TSMixer is designed for sequential multivariate time series data.

Therefore, a direct application of TSMixer is not feasible. However, we can leverage insights from the TSMixer paper and combine them with other suitable techniques to develop an effective methodology for NumerAI:

### Methodology

**1. Data Preparation:**

* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Analyze the feature sets and groups provided by NumerAI. 
    * Explore potential feature interactions and transformations to create new features that might be informative for predicting "alpha". 
    * Address missing values (NaN) using appropriate techniques like imputation or removal, depending on the feature and the amount of missing data. 
* **Era-wise Grouping:**
    * Group the data by "era" to treat each week as a single data point, aligning with NumerAI's recommendation and addressing the overlapping nature of target values.
    * Within each era, consider creating additional features based on aggregations or statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) of features across stocks.

**2. Model Selection:**

* **Ensemble of Gradient Boosting Trees:**
    * Given the tabular nature of the data and the classification task, an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) is a strong candidate due to its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships between features and its robustness to noise.
    * Explore different ensemble configurations and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

**3. Training and Evaluation:**

* **Cross-Validation:**
    * Implement a time-series aware cross-validation strategy to avoid data leakage from overlapping target values across eras.
    * Consider techniques like forward chaining or blocked cross-validation.
* **Metric Optimization:**
    * Optimize for the metric used by NumerAI (e.g., correlation, Sharpe ratio) to directly align with the competition's evaluation criteria. 

**4. Incorporating TSMixer Insights:**

* **Feature Mixing Inspiration:** 
    * Explore the use of MLP-based feature engineering techniques inspired by TSMixer's feature-mixing concept.
    * This could involve training small MLPs to learn complex transformations of existing features, potentially uncovering hidden relationships that improve prediction accuracy.
* **Temporal Pattern Analysis:**
    * Although NumerAI data is not a time series in the traditional sense, there might be temporal patterns within each era or across eras that can be informative.
    * Explore techniques like time-series decomposition or lag features to capture potential temporal dependencies.

**5. Handling the Entire Dataset:**

* **Incremental Training:**
    * If the dataset is too large to fit in memory at once, consider using incremental training methods. 
    * This involves splitting the data into smaller batches and training the model iteratively, updating its parameters with each batch.
* **Distributed Training:**
    * For extremely large datasets, explore distributed training frameworks like Spark or Dask to parallelize the training process across multiple machines.


### Pseudocode

```
# Data Preparation

# 1. Load NumerAI data
data = load_numerai_data()

# 2. Feature engineering (specific techniques depend on analysis)
engineered_features = create_engineered_features(data)

# 3. Group data by era and create era-wise features
grouped_data = group_by_era(data, engineered_features)

# Model Training and Evaluation

# 1. Define cross-validation strategy (e.g., forward chaining)
cv_strategy = define_time_series_cv()

# 2. Initialize ensemble model (e.g., XGBoost)
model = initialize_ensemble_model()

# 3. Loop through cross-validation folds
for train_data, val_data in cv_strategy.split(grouped_data):
    # 4. Train model on training data
    model.fit(train_data["features"], train_data["target"])
    
    # 5. Evaluate model on validation data
    predictions = model.predict(val_data["features"])
    metric = calculate_numerai_metric(val_data["target"], predictions)
    
    # 6. Store validation metric for hyperparameter tuning

# 4. Select best hyperparameters based on validation metrics

# 5. Train final model on the entire dataset (potentially using incremental/distributed training)
final_model = train_final_model(grouped_data)

# 6. Generate predictions for submission
predictions = final_model.predict(test_data["features"])

# 7. Submit predictions to NumerAI platform
submit_predictions(predictions)
```

**Note:** This pseudocode provides a high-level overview. Specific implementations will vary depending on the chosen feature engineering techniques, ensemble model, and cross-validation strategy.

**TSMixer Inspiration:**

* The feature engineering step could involve training small MLPs on subsets of features to learn complex transformations, inspired by TSMixer's feature-mixing.
* Analyzing temporal patterns within each era could be done using time-series decomposition or lag features.

**This methodology combines the strengths of ensemble methods for tabular data with insights from TSMixer to create a potentially powerful approach for NumerAI prediction.**
