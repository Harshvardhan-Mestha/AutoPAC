## Refining the Methodology for NumerAI Prediction

**Evaluation of Initial Methodology:**

1. **Explanation:** The initial methodology provides a clear explanation of the data preparation, model selection, and training/evaluation steps. However, the specific feature engineering techniques and the implementation of "TSMixer inspiration" require further elaboration. 
2. **Standard vs. Modified Methods:** The methodology primarily uses standard methods like gradient boosting trees and time-series aware cross-validation. The "TSMixer inspiration" introduces a novel aspect, but its implementation needs further specification.
3. **Limitations and Problems:** The methodology acknowledges the limitations of directly applying TSMixer and the challenge of handling the entire dataset. However, potential issues like overfitting, class imbalance, and the need for hyperparameter tuning require more attention.
4. **Appropriateness:** The choice of gradient boosting trees is appropriate for the tabular data and classification task. Exploring MLP-based feature engineering is a valid approach, but its effectiveness depends on careful implementation and evaluation.
5. **Adaptation from Literature Review:** The methodology draws inspiration from TSMixer's feature mixing concept but doesn't fully leverage the temporal aspects of the architecture.  

**Refined Methodology:**

**1. Data Preparation:**

* **Feature Engineering:**
    * **Exploration:** Analyze feature importance and correlations. Explore feature interactions (e.g., multiplication, ratios) and transformations (e.g., log, Box-Cox) to create new features.
    * **Missing Value Imputation:** Implement techniques like KNN imputation or iterative imputer, considering the nature of missingness and feature characteristics.
    * **Era-wise Feature Engineering:** 
        * Calculate era-wise statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for each feature across stocks.
        * Explore time-series decomposition (e.g., trend, seasonality) within each era to capture temporal patterns.
        * Consider lag features to capture dependencies on previous eras.

**2. Model Selection:**

* **Ensemble:** Maintain the use of gradient boosting trees (e.g., XGBoost) due to their suitability for the task.
* **MLP-based Feature Enhancement:**
    * **Implementation:** Train small MLPs on subsets of features, inspired by TSMixer's feature mixing. Experiment with different MLP architectures and activation functions.
    * **Integration:** Use the outputs of the MLPs as additional features for the gradient boosting model.

**3. Training and Evaluation:**

* **Cross-Validation:** Implement a robust time-series aware cross-validation strategy (e.g., blocked cross-validation) to prevent data leakage.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters for both the gradient boosting model and the MLPs.
* **Addressing Class Imbalance:** If the target classes are imbalanced, consider using techniques like class weighting or oversampling/undersampling during training.

**4. Handling the Entire Dataset:**

* **Incremental/Distributed Training:** Implement incremental training or explore distributed training frameworks like Spark if memory constraints arise.

**Refined Pseudocode:**

```
# Data Preparation

# 1. Load NumerAI data
data = load_numerai_data()

# 2. Feature engineering
engineered_features = create_engineered_features(data) # Specific techniques based on exploration

# 3. Impute missing values
imputed_data = impute_missing_values(data, engineered_features) # Choose appropriate imputation technique

# 4. Group data by era and create era-wise features
grouped_data = group_by_era(imputed_data)
era_features = create_era_wise_features(grouped_data) # Include era statistics, time-series decomposition, lag features

# MLP-based Feature Enhancement

# 1. Define MLP architecture and training parameters
mlp_model = define_mlp_architecture()
mlp_training_params = define_mlp_training_parameters()

# 2. Train MLPs on subsets of features
mlp_features = {}
for feature_subset in feature_subsets:
    mlp_model.fit(grouped_data[feature_subset], mlp_training_params)
    mlp_features[feature_subset] = mlp_model.predict(grouped_data[feature_subset])

# 3. Combine MLP outputs with original features
enhanced_features = combine_features(grouped_data, mlp_features)

# Model Training and Evaluation

# 1. Define cross-validation strategy (e.g., blocked cross-validation)
cv_strategy = define_time_series_cv()

# 2. Initialize ensemble model (e.g., XGBoost) and define hyperparameter grid
model = initialize_ensemble_model()
param_grid = define_hyperparameter_grid()

# 3. Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search or Bayesian optimization
best_params = optimize_hyperparameters(model, param_grid, enhanced_features, cv_strategy) 

# 4. Train final model on the entire dataset with best hyperparameters 
final_model = train_final_model(enhanced_features, best_params) # Consider incremental/distributed training 
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Continuously monitor model performance on the NumerAI leaderboard and adapt the methodology based on feedback and new insights. 
* **Experimentation:** Explore different feature engineering techniques, MLP architectures, and ensemble configurations to find the optimal combination for the NumerAI dataset.
