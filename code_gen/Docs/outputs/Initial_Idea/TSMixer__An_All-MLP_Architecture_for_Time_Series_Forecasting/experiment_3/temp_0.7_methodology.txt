## Methodology for NumerAI Prediction using TSMixer

Based on the provided information and the analysis of the TSMixer paper, here's a proposed methodology for tackling the NumerAI prediction problem:

**1. Relevance of TSMixer to NumerAI:**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Feature Mixing:** The NumerAI dataset contains a diverse set of features from various categories. TSMixer's ability to effectively mix features and capture complex relationships between them is highly relevant and potentially advantageous.
    * **Temporal Patterns:** While the target focuses on future returns, incorporating historical trends and patterns within each stock's data could provide valuable insights. TSMixer's time-mixing MLPs are well-suited for capturing such temporal dependencies.
    * **Scalability and Efficiency:**  Given the large size of the NumerAI dataset, TSMixer's computational efficiency and scalability compared to RNNs and Transformers are desirable.
* **Limitations:**
    * **Direct Applicability:** TSMixer, as presented in the paper, focuses on forecasting future values of time series data. NumerAI's target is not a direct future value but a measure of future returns relative to the current era.
    * **Handling Eras:** The paper doesn't explicitly address the concept of "eras" as presented in the NumerAI dataset. 

**2. Proposed Approach - Adapting TSMixer for NumerAI:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional feature engineering techniques beyond the provided features. This might involve creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., ratios, differences) or applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
    * **Handling NaN Values:** Implement strategies to address missing values (NaN) in features and auxiliary targets. Options include imputation (mean/median filling, KNN) or creating indicator features for missingness.
    * **Normalization:** Apply appropriate normalization techniques (e.g., standardization, min-max scaling) to features to ensure they are on a similar scale. 

2. **Model Design - Modified TSMixer:**

    * **Input Representation:** Instead of directly predicting future values, the model will predict the relative future returns for each stock within each era. 
    * **Era Embedding:** Incorporate an "era embedding" layer to capture potential era-specific information. This could be a learned embedding vector for each era or features derived from the era itself (e.g., day of the week, month).
    * **Target Representation:** Experiment with different representations for the target variable:
        * **Regression:** Treat the target as a continuous value and use a regression loss function (e.g., MSE).
        * **Classification:** Treat the target as a categorical variable with 5 classes and use a classification loss function (e.g., cross-entropy).
    * **Auxiliary Targets:** Explore ways to leverage the auxiliary targets during training:
        * **Multi-task Learning:** Train the model to predict both the main target and auxiliary targets simultaneously using a shared representation.
        * **Feature Engineering:** Derive new features from the auxiliary targets and incorporate them as additional input features. 

3. **Training and Evaluation:**
    * **Training Strategy:** Implement a robust training strategy that addresses the overlapping nature of targets across eras. Consider techniques like:
        * **Era-based Cross-Validation:** Split the data into folds based on eras rather than individual data points to avoid leakage.
        * **Walk-forward Validation:** Use a rolling window approach for validation, where the model is trained on past eras and evaluated on future eras.
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** 
        * **Correlation:** Use the "mean correlation per era" metric as the primary evaluation metric, aligning with NumerAI's focus.
        * **Additional Metrics:** Monitor other relevant metrics like MSE or classification accuracy depending on the chosen target representation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    * Conduct thorough hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. Explore different configurations for:
        * Number of layers and hidden units in the time-mixing and feature-mixing MLPs.
        * Learning rate and optimizer settings.
        * Dropout rates.
        * Era embedding dimension (if used). 

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
# Data Preprocessing
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Feature engineering (e.g., create new features, dimensionality reduction)
    # Handle NaN values (e.g., imputation, indicator features)
    # Normalize features
    return preprocessed_data

# Model Definition - Modified TSMixer
class NumeraiTSMixer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, era_embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, num_targets):
        # Define layers: era embedding, time-mixing MLPs, feature-mixing MLPs, temporal projection, output layer
        # ...

    def forward(self, x, era_ids):
        # Embed era information
        era_embedding = self.era_embedding(era_ids)
        # Pass data through time-mixing and feature-mixing MLPs
        # ...
        # Project to output dimension (regression or classification)
        return output

# Training Loop
def train_model(model, train_data, val_data, epochs, optimizer, loss_fn):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Era-based or walk-forward cross-validation
        for era_data in train_data:
            # Forward pass, calculate loss, backpropagate, update weights
            # ...
        # Evaluate on validation data
        # ...

# Evaluation
def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    # Calculate correlation per era and other relevant metrics
    # ...

# Main Script
# Load NumerAI data
data = load_numerai_data()
# Preprocess data
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)
# Create model instance
model = NumeraiTSMixer(...)
# Define optimizer and loss function
optimizer = ...
loss_fn = ...
# Train model

# Evaluate model on test data
evaluate_model(model, ...)
```

**4. Potential Challenges and Future Improvements:**

* **Overfitting:** Despite TSMixer's efficiency, overfitting remains a potential challenge with complex datasets like NumerAI. Regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization) and early stopping should be employed to mitigate this risk.
* **Interpretability:** While TSMixer offers a simpler architecture than RNNs or Transformers, interpreting its predictions and understanding the importance of different features remains a challenge. Exploring techniques like attention visualization or feature importance analysis could provide valuable insights.
* **Alternative Architectures:** Consider exploring other architectures with similar properties to TSMixer, such as CNN-based models or hybrid approaches that combine MLPs with other techniques. 

**5. Conclusion:**

By adapting TSMixer's strengths to the specific characteristics of the NumerAI dataset and addressing its limitations, this proposed methodology offers a promising approach for building a robust and efficient prediction model. The combination of feature mixing, temporal pattern recognition, and scalability makes TSMixer a compelling choice for tackling this complex financial forecasting problem.
