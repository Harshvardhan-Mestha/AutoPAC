## Refining the Methodology for NumerAI Prediction using TSMixer

**Explanation:**

The proposed methodology provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the steps involved in adapting TSMixer for the NumerAI prediction problem. It covers data preprocessing, model design modifications, training and evaluation strategies, and hyperparameter tuning. Each step is explained with sufficient detail to allow for implementation.

**Standard vs. Modified Methods:**

The methodology primarily utilizes standard data preprocessing techniques like feature engineering, handling missing values, and normalization. However, the TSMixer model itself is modified to incorporate an era embedding layer and adapt to the prediction of relative future returns instead of direct future values. These modifications are well-explained and justified based on the specific characteristics of the NumerAI dataset.

**Limitations and Problems:**

The methodology acknowledges potential challenges such as overfitting and interpretability, suggesting appropriate techniques like regularization and attention visualization to address them. However, additional limitations and potential problems could be considered:

* **Data Leakage:** Due to the overlapping nature of targets across eras, there is a risk of data leakage during training and validation. More sophisticated cross-validation strategies or data augmentation techniques might be needed to mitigate this risk. 
* **Class Imbalance:** The distribution of target values in the NumerAI dataset may be imbalanced, with certain classes being more frequent than others. This could affect the model's performance, and techniques like class weighting or oversampling/undersampling might be necessary. 
* **Non-stationarity:** Financial markets are often non-stationary, meaning their statistical properties change over time. The current methodology assumes stationarity, and exploring techniques like time-series decomposition or incorporating additional features to capture non-stationarity could be beneficial.

**Appropriateness:**

TSMixer's ability to handle diverse feature sets, capture temporal patterns, and scale efficiently makes it a suitable choice for the NumerAI problem. However, alternative architectures could be explored for comparison:

* **Transformer-based models:** While TSMixer offers efficiency advantages, Transformers with their strong ability to capture long-range dependencies could be considered, especially if long-term trends are important. 
* **Hybrid models:** Combining TSMixer with other techniques like RNNs for capturing sequential information or attention mechanisms for focusing on specific features could be explored.

**Adaptation from Literature Review:**

The methodology effectively adapts the insights from the literature review on TSMixer. The focus on feature mixing and temporal pattern recognition aligns well with the characteristics of the NumerAI dataset. The modifications to incorporate era embeddings and adapt to relative future returns demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and the model's capabilities.

## Refined Methodology:

**1. Data Preprocessing:**

* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Explore creating new features based on domain knowledge or automated feature generation techniques.
    * Analyze feature importance and consider dropping irrelevant or redundant features.
* **Handling NaN Values:**
    * Implement a combination of imputation techniques (e.g., median filling for numerical features, mode imputation for categorical features) and indicator features for missingness.
* **Normalization:**
    * Apply standardization to numerical features to ensure zero mean and unit variance.
    * Explore different scaling techniques for categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding, target encoding).

**2. Model Design - Modified TSMixer:**

* **Input Representation:**
    * Concatenate era embeddings and preprocessed features as input to the model.
* **Era Embedding:**
    * Implement a learned embedding layer for eras or incorporate features like day of the week, month, and year as era-specific information.
* **Target Representation:**
    * Start with a regression approach, treating the target as a continuous value and using MSE loss. 
    * Explore a classification approach with class weighting or oversampling/undersampling techniques to address potential class imbalance.
* **Auxiliary Targets:**
    * Implement a multi-task learning approach, predicting both the main target and auxiliary targets simultaneously using shared representations in the initial layers of the model.

**3. Training and Evaluation:**

* **Training Strategy:**
    * Implement a combination of era-based cross-validation and walk-forward validation to mitigate data leakage and assess model generalizability.
    * Explore techniques like gradient clipping or adaptive learning rate schedulers to improve training stability. 
* **Evaluation Metrics:**
    * Primarily focus on the "mean correlation per era" metric.
    * Monitor MSE or classification accuracy as secondary metrics depending on the chosen target representation.

**4. Hyperparameter Tuning:**

* Conduct a grid search or randomized search to explore a wide range of hyperparameter configurations, focusing on the number of layers, hidden units, learning rate, dropout rates, and era embedding dimensions.
