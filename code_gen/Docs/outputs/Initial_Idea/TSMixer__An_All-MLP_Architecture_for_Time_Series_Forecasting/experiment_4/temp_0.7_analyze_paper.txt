**Abstract Review**:
The paper presents a novel architecture, TSMixer, designed for time-series forecasting. It leverages multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle both time and feature dimensions efficiently, which is a shift from the commonly used recurrent and attention-based models. The model demonstrates superior performance on the M5 benchmark, highlighting its capability in handling large-scale and real-world datasets.

**Methodology Review**:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   - TSMixer addresses the challenge of forecasting multivariate time-series data, which is crucial across various applications like product demand forecasting, disease spread modeling, and economic indicators forecasting.

2. **TSMixer Architecture**:
   - **Core Components**: The architecture is built around interleaving time-mixing and feature-mixing MLPs, aiming to aggregate information across both dimensions effectively.
   - **Time-Mixing MLPs**: These are applied row-wise across all features, focusing on temporal dynamics.
   - **Feature-Mixing MLPs**: These operate column-wise across all time steps, capturing interactions between different features.

3. **Design Choices**:
   - The use of MLPs for both time and feature mixing is pivotal. This design choice simplifies the implementation compared to more complex recurrent or attention-based models, potentially reducing the risk of overfitting while maintaining or improving forecasting accuracy.
   - **Residual Connections**: These are included to facilitate deeper architectures without compromising on training efficiency. It allows each layer to learn modifications to the identity mapping of its input, enhancing the flow of gradients during training.
   - **Normalization Techniques**: The model utilizes 2D normalization, which is not typical in standard MLP architectures. This choice caters to the unique needs of mixing operations across time and features.

4. **Auxiliary Information Handling**:
   - TSMixer extends its architecture to incorporate auxiliary information by aligning different feature types into the same shape and then applying mixer layers on the concatenated features. This approach is particularly noted for its effectiveness in practical applications where additional context can significantly enhance forecasting accuracy.

5. **Empirical Evaluation**:
   - TSMixer is compared with state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks and a large-scale real-world dataset (M5). The model not only performs on par with specialized univariate models but also outperforms other multivariate models, validating the effectiveness of its methodology.

6. **Theoretical Insights**:
   - The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the capacity of linear models to capture temporal relationships, which underpins the design of TSMixer. This theoretical foundation is crucial for understanding why the proposed model performs effectively across different datasets and settings.

**Critical Analysis**:
- **Strengths**:
  - The modular design of TSMixer, using MLPs for both time and feature mixing, simplifies the model architecture while ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets.
  - The extension to handle auxiliary information is well-thought-out, demonstrating the model’s flexibility and applicability in real-world scenarios.

- **Potential Limitations**:
  - While the model performs well on large datasets, the scalability and efficiency in training on even larger datasets or in a streaming data scenario are not discussed.
  - The impact of the depth of MLP layers on the model's performance and training dynamics could be explored further.

- **Future Work Suggestions**:
  - Investigating the application of TSMixer to other types of time-series data, such as irregularly sampled time series or those with higher dimensionality.
  - Exploring the integration of TSMixer with other machine learning frameworks to enhance its predictive capabilities or reduce computational overhead.
