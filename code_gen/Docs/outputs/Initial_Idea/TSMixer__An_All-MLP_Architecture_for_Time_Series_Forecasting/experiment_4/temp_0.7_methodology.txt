**Methodology for Applying TSMixer to NumerAI Dataset**

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Dataset**
- **Objective**: Develop a model to forecast stock-specific returns using the NumerAI dataset, which includes multiple features and targets over various eras.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset, including the distribution of features, handling missing values, and exploring the correlation between different features and targets.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Apply imputation techniques where necessary, especially for features with missing values. For features where data is not available, consider using mean or median imputation, or a more sophisticated approach like K-nearest neighbors (KNN).
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might help in improving the model's performance. This could include interaction terms, polynomial features, or domain-specific features.
- **Normalization**: Scale the features using Min-Max scaling or Standardization to standardize the range of independent variables.

**Step 3: Adapting TSMixer for the NumerAI Dataset**
- **Customization of TSMixer**: Modify TSMixer to handle the multivariate nature of the NumerAI dataset. This includes adjusting the architecture to work with a larger number of features and potentially different types of data (e.g., categorical data).
- **Temporal and Feature Mixing**: Implement temporal mixing to capture temporal patterns across different eras and feature mixing to capture interactions between different types of features. This is consistent with the TSMixer architecture discussed in the literature.
- **Integration of Auxiliary Information**: If auxiliary targets are available, integrate these into the TSMixer model to enhance prediction accuracy. This involves modifying the input layer to include auxiliary information and adjusting the mixing layers accordingly.

**Step 4: Model Training**
- **Splitting the Data**: Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets. Given the structure of the data with different eras, ensure that the splitting respects the temporal nature of the data to avoid leakage.
- **Model Configuration**: Configure the model parameters such as the number of layers, the size of the MLPs, dropout rates, and learning rates.
- **Training Process**: Train the model using the training dataset with validation based on the validation set. Monitor the training process for signs of overfitting or underfitting and adjust the model parameters as necessary.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement**
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or any relevant financial performance metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune the model parameters to achieve the best performance on the validation dataset.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation, particularly focusing on time-series cross-validation to assess model performance over different time periods.

**Step 6: Deployment and Monitoring**
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment where it can receive new data and make predictions.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the model's performance in the live environment and retrain it with new data as necessary to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
