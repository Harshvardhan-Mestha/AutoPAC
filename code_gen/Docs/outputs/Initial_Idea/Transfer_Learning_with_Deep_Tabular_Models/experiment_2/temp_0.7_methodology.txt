## Methodology for NumerAI Prediction with Transfer Learning

Based on the insights from the literature review and the characteristics of the NumerAI dataset, we propose a methodology that leverages transfer learning with deep tabular models to predict stock-specific returns ("alpha").

**Model Selection:**

* **FT-Transformer:** Given its strong performance in the literature review, especially with larger datasets and its ability to handle mixed data types, the FT-Transformer will be the primary model for this task.

**Addressing Limitations:**

* **Computational Cost:** To mitigate the computational cost associated with FT-Transformer, we will explore efficient implementations and consider using cloud-based GPU resources for training.
* **Data Heterogeneity:** While NumerAI features are engineered to be predictive, they may exhibit heterogeneity across eras. The pseudo-feature method will be employed to handle potential missing values and inconsistencies.

**Methodology Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Quantile Transformation:** Apply quantile transformation to numerical features to ensure a standard distribution for the FT-Transformer.
    * **Missing Value Imputation:**
        * For features missing in the upstream data but present in the downstream data:
            * Train a model on the upstream data to predict the missing feature values.
            * Use the trained model to impute the missing values in the upstream data, creating an augmented dataset.
        * For features missing in both upstream and downstream data: Impute with the mean for numerical features and a new category for categorical features.

2. **Transfer Learning Setup:**
    * **Upstream Training:**
        * Train the FT-Transformer on a subset of eras (e.g., the first 70%) as a multi-target regression model, predicting the target values for each era.
        * Tune hyperparameters using Optuna with Bayesian optimization on the upstream data.
    * **Downstream Fine-tuning:**
        * Fine-tune the pre-trained FT-Transformer on the remaining eras (e.g., the last 30%) with a smaller learning rate.
        * Use an MLP head on top of the pre-trained feature extractor for the final prediction.
        * Consider both frozen and fine-tuned feature extractor setups and choose the best performing option based on validation performance. 

3. **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the model's performance using metrics relevant to NumerAI, such as correlation and mean squared error on the target values.
    * Compare the performance of the transfer learning approach with baselines, including training the FT-Transformer from scratch and using GBDT models with and without stacking.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# 1. Data Preprocessing

# Load NumerAI data
data = load_numerai_data()

# Split data into upstream and downstream eras
upstream_data, downstream_data = split_data_by_era(data, train_ratio=0.7)

# Quantile transform numerical features
upstream_data, downstream_data = quantile_transform(upstream_data, downstream_data)

# Impute missing values using pseudo-feature method
upstream_data = impute_missing_features(upstream_data, downstream_data)

# 2. Transfer Learning Setup

# Initialize FT-Transformer model
model = FTTransformer()

# Train on upstream data
model.fit(upstream_data, epochs=500, patience=30, hyperparameter_tuning=True)

# Fine-tune on downstream data
model.finetune(downstream_data, epochs=200, learning_rate=5e-5, head="MLP")

# 3. Evaluation

# Evaluate performance on downstream data
correlation, mse = model.evaluate(downstream_data)

# Compare with baselines
# ... (train FT-Transformer from scratch, train GBDT models)

# Select best model based on evaluation results
# ...
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional feature engineering techniques specific to financial data, such as incorporating time-series features or sentiment analysis.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Consider combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., FT-Transformer with different pre-training setups or GBDT models) to improve robustness andgeneralizability. 

**This methodology provides a comprehensive framework for applying transfer learning with deep tabular models to the NumerAI dataset. By carefully addressing limitations and leveraging the strengths of the FT-Transformer, we aim to achieve high prediction accuracy and consistent performance in the challenging task of predicting stock-specific returns.**
