Given the high-level idea of implementing a volatility-based trading system using machine learning and statistics, the provided dataset, and the literature review I performed earlier, here is my proposed methodology using a chain of thought approach:

1) Introduce the methodological approach:
The methodology will follow a quantitative approach, combining statistical analysis techniques with machine learning models to develop a volatility-based algorithmic trading strategy using the provided stock market dataset.

2) Establish methodological connection: 
The quantitative approach aligns with the research problem of forecasting stock market trends and identifying profitable trading opportunities based on volatility patterns. Statistical methods like volatility clustering and causality tests, coupled with machine learning for pattern recognition, directly address this objective.

3) Data preprocessing:
- Handle missing/corrupted data through imputation or removal techniques
- Normalize/standardize numerical features as needed
- Split data into training/validation/test sets
- Perform feature selection/extraction if needed 

4) Volatility feature engineering:
- Calculate historical volatility measures (e.g. Parkinson, Garman-Klass, Rogers-Satchell, Yang-Zhang estimators) using stock OHLCV data
- Construct volatility time series data for each stock

5) Volatility clustering:
- Apply k-means++ clustering on volatility time series data
- Use dynamic time warping as distance metric to handle time series
- Cluster stocks into high/medium/low volatility regimes

6) Granger causality testing:
- From the medium volatility cluster, test for Granger causality between stock pairs
- Iterate over lag periods (e.g. 2 to 30 days) to find optimal lag
- Identify predictive relationships between stocks based on Granger F-test

7) Trading strategy rule extraction:
- For stock pairs with Granger causality, use "predictor" stock to guide trading of "target" stock
- Develop trading rules: buy/sell/hold based on predictor stock trend
- Optionally use technical indicators like moving averages as filters

8) Model training/validation: 
- Train a machine learning model (e.g. random forest, XGBoost) to learn patterns from volatility features, technical indicators, and extracted trading rules
- Use validation set to tune hyperparameters and assess generalization

9) Backtesting and evaluation:
- Apply the trained model to the test dataset for backtesting the trading strategy  
- Calculate performance metrics: profit/loss, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown etc.
- Compare against benchmarks like buy-and-hold 

10) Addressing limitations:
- Data limitations: Backtest over expanded time periods, add more stocks
- Model limitations: Ensemble multiple models, explore deep learning 
- Risk management: Set stop-loss, position-sizing, capital allocation rules

The overall methodology combines the literature concepts of volatility estimation, clustering, causality testing and integrates them into an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to develop robust volatility-based trading strategies. Statistical validations ensure relationships are non-spurious. Extensive backtesting and evaluation aims to ensure strategy effectiveness.
