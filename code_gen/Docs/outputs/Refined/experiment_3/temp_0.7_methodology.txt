## Methodology for Applying Conservative Predictions with TabPFN on Numerai Data

Considering the high-level idea of using TabPFN with a conservative prediction strategy on the Numerai dataset, and keeping in mind the limitations of TabPFN, here's a potential methodology:

**Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values (NaNs) in both features and auxiliary targets.  Options include imputation (e.g., mean/median filling, KNN imputation) or creating indicator variables for missingness.
2. **Feature Selection/Engineering:**
    * **Dimensionality Reduction:**  Since TabPFN is limited to 100 features, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or feature importance analysis might be needed, especially when using the "large" feature set. 
    * **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating new features based on domain knowledge or combinations of existing features, potentially improving model performance.
3. **Target Engineering:** 
    * Focus on the main target variable for predicting stock-specific returns ("alpha").
    * Consider incorporating auxiliary targets as additional features or creating a multi-task learning framework to leverage the information they provide. 
4. **Era-wise Splitting:** Divide the data into era-wise sets, where each era represents a single data point as recommended for the Numerai dataset.

**Step 2: Addressing TabPFN Limitations**

1. **Data Size Limitation:**
    * **Chunking:**  Divide the data into smaller chunks with less than 10,000 data points each. Train separate TabPFN models on each chunk and ensemble their predictions. 
    * **Sampling:**  If chunking is not feasible, consider sampling eras from the dataset to create smaller training sets.  This might require careful stratification to maintain the distribution of eras and target values. 
2. **Class Number Limitation:**
    * The Numerai target variable has 5 classes, which is within TabPFN's limit.  No action is needed for this limitation.

**Step 3: Implementing Conservative Predictions with TabPFN**

1. **Model Training:** Train a TabPFN model on each data chunk or sample (as determined in Step 2).
2. **Confidence Estimation:**
    * Use the model's predicted class probabilities to estimate confidence.  Gini impurity, as used in the paper, is a suitable metric. 
    * Alternatively, explore other confidence measures such as entropy or the maximum predicted probability.
3. **Thresholding:**  Set a threshold for the chosen confidence metric.  Predictions below this threshold will be considered "uncertain."
4. **Cascading (Optional):** 
    * If desired, implement a cascading approach where uncertain predictions from the first model are passed to a second TabPFN model trained on a different chunk or sample of data.  This can be repeated for multiple stages. 
    * Evaluate the trade-off between increased support and potential overfitting when using cascading. 

**Step 4: Evaluation**

1. Evaluate the performance of the model(s) using metrics such as accuracy, support, utility, DRAR, and Traded Sharpe Ratio as described in the paper. 
2. Compare the performance of the conservative prediction approach with a baseline TabPFN model that makes predictions on all data points.
3. Analyze the distribution of confident predictions and their alignment with the extremes of the target variable.

**Step 5:  Pseudocode**

```python
# Assuming necessary libraries are imported and data is preprocessed

def train_conservative_tabpfn(data, confidence_threshold, num_models=1):
    models = []
    for i in range(num_models):
        # Split data into chunks or samples (if necessary)
        if data_size_exceeds_limit:
            data_chunk = get_data_chunk(data, chunk_size)
        else:
            data_chunk = data
        
        # Train TabPFN model
        model = TabPFN()
        model.fit(data_chunk)
        models.append(model)

    return models

def predict_conservatively(models, data, confidence_threshold):
    predictions = []
    for x in data:
        for model in models:
            y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(x)
            confidence = calculate_gini_impurity(y_pred_proba)
            if confidence <= confidence_threshold:
                predictions.append(y_pred_proba)
                break  # Move to the next data point 
        else:
            predictions.append(None)  # No confident prediction 
    
    return predictions

# Example usage
models = train_conservative_tabpfn(numerai_data, confidence_threshold=0.5, num_models=2)
predictions = predict_conservatively(models, test_data, confidence_threshold=0.5)

# Evaluate performance using chosen metrics
...
