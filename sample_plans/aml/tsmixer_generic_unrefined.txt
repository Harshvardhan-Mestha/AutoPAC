Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and dataset description. Based on the literature review on the TSMixer paper and the given high-level idea of implementing it for tabular classification on stock market data, here is my proposed methodology using the chain of thought approach:

1) Introduce the methodological approach:
The methodological approach will be to adapt and apply the TSMixer architecture, which was originally proposed for multivariate time series forecasting, to the task of tabular classification on stock market data. This will involve modifying the architecture to handle tabular inputs and produce classification outputs instead of regression outputs.

2) Establish methodological connection: 
The TSMixer architecture was shown to be effective at capturing both temporal patterns and cross-feature dependencies in time series data through its interleaving time-mixing and feature-mixing MLP layers. For tabular stock market data, temporal dependencies may exist between the sequential rows (representing different time points), and cross-feature dependencies are likely present between the various technical indicators. Therefore, adapting TSMixer's design of alternating MLPs along the row and feature dimensions could allow it to effectively model this structured tabular data.

3) Introduce the model architecture:
The adapted TSMixer model will take the tabular data as input, with rows representing time steps and columns as different features/variates. 
- Time-mixing MLPs will be applied row-wise, shared across all features, to capture temporal patterns.
- Feature-mixing MLPs will be applied column-wise, shared across all time steps, to model cross-feature interactions.
- Residual connections and normalization will be employed similar to the original TSMixer.
- The output will be passed through a final classification layer to produce probability scores over the target classes.

4) Discuss analysis:
The model will be trained in a supervised manner using the provided targets (target_10_val and target_5_val) by optimizing a cross-entropy classification loss.
Standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) will be used.
The eras can be treated as separate examples during training/evaluation.

5) Provide background information:
The MLP Mixer paradigm was originally proposed for computer vision tasks but has shown effectiveness in other domains like natural language processing. The TSMixer paper demonstrated its applicability to time series forecasting by analyzing the strengths of linear models for capturing temporal patterns.

6) Discuss sampling process: 
The dataset will be split into train/validation/test sets following standard practice, with stratification based on the target values to maintain balanced class distributions.
Appropriate cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold) can be employed during the model selection/hyperparameter tuning process.

7) Address limitations:
A potential limitation is that the proposed adaptation assumes temporal dependencies exist between consecutive rows, which may not hold if the row ordering does not correspond to a true temporal sequence.
The exclusion of static features like row_num and era is another limitation, as they could provide supplementary information for improving predictions. Extending TSMixer to incorporate static/auxiliary features, as described in the original paper, could be explored.
Techniques like hyperparameter tuning and ensembling may be required to fully unlock TSMixer's potential on this dataset.

By adapting the TSMixer architecture and leveraging its strengths in modeling both temporal and cross-feature interactions, we aim to develop an effective model for tabular classification on the given stock market dataset. The proposed methodology accounts for the key aspects highlighted in the literature review while addressing the specifics of the problem at hand.
